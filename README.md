# Rocket
Experimental game engine in Java for developing games in the style of SimCity 2000.

## Notes
* This is *NOT YET* a functional game!  It will compile and run and you can assign zone tiles, but nothing else will happen.
* To run, get the whole thing to compile.   Run the "Colony" module to make the game go.
* Written in Java 12 with JavaFX 13.0 on Apache Netbeans 11.2 and compiled with Maven.  This will not run on previous versions of Java (like version 8).
* The UI, layout and style are influenced by Sim City 2000 but similarities end there.  Actual game play will be largely differenct.
* The premise of the "Colony" game is that you are building a colony on Mars.  The analogs to Residential, Commercial, Industrial have been morphed into Habitat, Agriculture and Fabrication.
* The money/currency mechanism is a place holder and might be replaced with something more reflective of a remote colony where money doesn't really mean anything.  Maybe a balace of multiple resources like Water/Minerals/Energy?
* Contact Maehem with comments or concerns.  I will start an issue tracker soon.
